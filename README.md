# Solana Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of the skills I have learned while exploring Solana over the past three weeks. The project includes scripts that showcase essential concepts such as cryptography, reading data from accounts, and writing data to accounts on the Solana blockchain.

### Scripts

- **generate-keypair.ts**: Demonstrates basic cryptographic operations used in Solana, including keypair generation and signing.
  
- **lesson3.ts**: A script that reads balance in SOL on a specified account on the Solana blockchain.
  
- **lesson4.ts**: A script that  send SOL from one account to another
